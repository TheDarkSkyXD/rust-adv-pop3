## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Async with tokio — industry standard, largest ecosystem
- [Roadmap]: Dual TLS via feature flags (openssl + rustls) — mutual exclusion enforced by compile_error!
- [Roadmap]: Major version bump to v2.0 — API breaking changes justify semver major
- [Roadmap]: Drop sync API — async-only; sync callers use block_on
- [Codebase]: Single-file library at src/pop3.rs (~537 lines), zero existing tests, four known bugs
- [Milestone]: v3.0 Advanced Features defined from GitHub issue #2 — pipelining, UIDL caching, reconnection, pooling, mailparse

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: OpenSSL build on Windows CI is documented as problematic — may need `vendored` feature or limit openssl support to Linux/macOS. Decide in Phase 3.
- [Phase 4]: STARTTLS BufReader drain behavior is under-documented in tokio ecosystem. Validate against Outlook and Gmail (known to coalesce TCP segments) during Phase 4, not just mock server.
